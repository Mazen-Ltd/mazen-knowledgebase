## Service Renewal & Suspension
Renewing your service is simple:
- 14 days before your service expires, an invoice will be generated and you will be notified via email. 
- You will also receive a notification 7 days before your service expires.
- If you pass the due date, your service will be suspended on the 2nd day after the due date.
- After 7 days of suspension, your service will be terminated and all data will be lost, after that you cannot renew your service.

You can also generate invoices for a service at any time manually from the client zone. Through the Generate Invoice button.
