### VPS Upgrades/Downgrades
For VPS services Downgrades are not available, since we cannot change the disk size of a VPS. However, you can upgrade your VPS at any time. The upgrade will be done automatically and you will not lose any data.
You will have to shutdown and start your VPS after the upgrade is done to apply the changes.

### Minecraft & Game Hosting Upgrades/Downgrades
For Minecraft and Game Hosting services, you can upgrade or downgrade your service at any time. The upgrade/downgrade will be done automatically and you will not lose any data.
You may need to restart the server, so you get the full ram memory from the new plan. The CPU changes are applied without restart.
