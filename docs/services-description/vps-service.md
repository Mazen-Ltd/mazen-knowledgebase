## Technical Delivery Details - VPS

### Virtualization & Hosting
- **Virtualization Technology**: We utilize `Virtualizor` as our hypervisor and adopt KVM for virtualization, ensuring reliability and performance.

- **No Overselling**: Integrity is core to our service; hence, we do not oversell our VPS services.

- **Hosting Location**: At the moment, our VPS services are exclusively hosted in Sofia, Bulgaria.

###  Security
- **Email Notification**: Upon the creation of a VPS, users will be notified via email with crucial data including the root password.

- **Security Recommendations**: We urge users to change the root password post-receipt for security purposes. Alternatively, SSH keys are advocated as one of the most secure authentication methods.

### Control Panel & Features
- **Dedicated Control Panel**: Users are provided with a dedicated control panel accessible at [https://vps-control.mazenhost.com/](https://vps-control.mazenhost.com/). Through this panel, you can:

    - Start, stop, and restart your VPS
    - Reinstall the OS
    - Change the root password
    - Harness all features that Virtualizor offers
