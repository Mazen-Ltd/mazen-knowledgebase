Sometimes, in managing a server, we encounter problems with a plugin. Perhaps it's a specific setting of a particular plugin, or you might not be able to configure another one. Well, don't worry because as you probably know from the title of the article - "Documentation Is Your Friend!"

## What Is Documentation
Let's start with the question: what is documentation? Usually, when we configure plugins on our Minecraft server, we often have to read their documentation. We can think of it as a guide to the plugin, like the manual for a car (yes, the booklets we keep in the glove compartment) or the manual for an electronic device like a TV.

### What Documentation Contains
In most cases, the documentation of a plugin is much more detailed than those of electronic devices (the same cannot be said for car manuals, though), and it contains important information about the plugin. It includes the functions the plugin performs or offers, a detailed description of the plugin's settings, how to use the plugin's commands, other plugins that this plugin is compatible with, and so on.

## When to Refer to Documentation
You can refer to the documentation at any time. Usually, it's when we have a specific problem with the plugin or don't know what a particular setting does. In most cases, though, configuration files with settings come with so-called comments that explain what a specific setting does. Sometimes, these comments may point to the documentation for more information about the setting.
