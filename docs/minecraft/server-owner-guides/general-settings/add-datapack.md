Data Packs are a great way to add additional elements to your Minecraft server, such as new mobs, biomes, items, and more. They are not entirely compatible with all server software.

They can be added to both a normal world and a Minecraft server.

## How to Add a Data Pack

1. Download the Data Pack you want to use. Typically, it should be in the form of a `.zip` archive.
2. Connect to the server using an FTP/sFTP client, such as WinSCP.
3. Open the folder of the server's world, often `/world`.
4. Then, open the `/datapacks` folder.
5. Place the archive in the folder and wait for it to upload. The time it takes for the Data Pack to upload varies depending on your internet connection and internet speed.
6. Once you've finished uploading, simply restart your server!

These are all the steps you need to follow to add a Data Pack to your server.

:::caution Caution

Keep in mind that a Data Pack may not always effectively replace a specific plugin. If you want more complex and advanced functionality, it's best to use a plugin that provides it. Our article on [**Adding a Plugin**](add-plugin.md) will help you add a plugin to your server!
