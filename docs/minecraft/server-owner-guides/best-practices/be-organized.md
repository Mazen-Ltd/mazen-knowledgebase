When it comes to leading and administrating a public Minecraft server, it's crucial to be organized in what we do and with our server files.

## Organize Your Ideas in One Place
It's beneficial to organize the ideas we have in one centralized place so that we can implement them faster, more easily, and more efficiently. This can be achieved through note-taking apps, reminders, and more.

From personal experience, I could recommend Notion and Trello. They are free and allow collaboration with others.

## Organize Your Files in One Place
Undoubtedly, another essential aspect is being organized concerning your server files. This includes the server's worlds, server and plugin configuration files, databases, and so on. It's advisable always to make regular backups and keep local copies on your computer.
