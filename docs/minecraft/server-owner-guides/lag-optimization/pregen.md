If you've read the previous two articles: **[Find the Cause of Lag](find-cause.md)** and **[Optimize Your Server](optimization.md)**, you've probably come across the topic of "Chunk Pre-generation." In this article, we'll show you how to generate chunks in your server using the Chunky plugin and how to set world borders using the ChunkyBorder plugin. These are the two easiest plugins you can use to pre-generate and optimize your server.

## Pre-generating Chunks with Chunky
Pre-generating chunks in a specific world using Chunky is super easy! Just follow the steps described below, and you'll get it done in no time.

### Steps for pre-generation
1. Download the Chunky plugin from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/).
2. Start/Restart your server!
3. Select the world you want to pre-generate chunks for using the command ``/chunky world [world name]``, e.g., world, world_nether, world_the_end. In this case, we'll choose the world named "world" since it's the main world of our server, and we want to pre-generate it.
4. Then, use the command ``/chunky radius [number of blocks]`` to choose the radius of blocks you want to pre-generate. We recommend pre-generating a radius between 2000 and 5000 blocks, depending on your server type.
5. Wait for the blocks to pre-generate! Depending on the number of blocks you chose to pre-generate, this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour or even a few days.
6. The blocks in your selected world are now pre-generated!

## Adding a World Border Using ChunkyBorder
That's right! Chunk pre-generation isn't the only thing we can do, especially if we have a public Minecraft server. Adding a world border, also known as WorldBorder, is essential to prevent players from going beyond the world's boundaries and loading new chunks that haven't been pre-generated by Chunky.

The steps are once again extremely easy, and as long as you follow them, you can't go wrong!

### Steps for adding a border / worldborder
1. Download the ChunkyBorder plugin from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunkyborder.84278/).
2. Start/Restart your server!
3. Select the world for which you want to set a border using the command ``/chunky world [world name]``, e.g., world, world_nether, world_the_end. In this case, we'll select the "world" world since we pre-generated it in the previous steps.
4. Then, use the command ``/chunky radius [number of blocks]`` to choose the number of blocks you pre-generated in the given world.
5. Use the command ``/chunky add`` to add the world's border.
6. You've just added a border to the pre-generated "world" world in your Minecraft server!

:::note Note

Keep in mind that if you already have a location serving as the Spawn Point on your server, you'll likely need to set it in advance so that Chunky knows it should be the center of the world. You can do this using the command: ``/chunky center [X and Z coordinates]``.
