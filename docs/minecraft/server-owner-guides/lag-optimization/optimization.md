## [YouHaveTrouble - minecraft-optimization](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization)
I highly recommend reading YouHaveTrouble's guide on server optimization because it covers several important topics and settings that you can apply.

:::caution Caution

Since every Minecraft server is different, I strongly recommend not copying the settings from YouHaveTrouble's guide but rather carefully reading how each setting changes and affects your server!

:::note Note

YouHaveTrouble's minecraft-optimization guide is in English. If you're not proficient in the language, you may have difficulty understanding it. We'll try to translate the guide into Bulgarian very soon!
