Plugins are addons that can add additional elements and functionality to your Minecraft server, such as mobs, biomes, powerful commands, and more.

Unlike Data Packs, plugins are only supported by software like Spigot, Paper, Pufferfish, Purpur, and others. They cannot be installed on a server using Vanilla server software!

## How to Add a Plugin

1. Download the plugin you want to use from a website like SpigotMC or BuiltByBit.
2. Connect to the server using an FTP/sFTP client, such as WinSCP.
3. Open the `/plugins` folder, where plugins are placed.
4. Put the plugin in the folder and wait for it to upload. The time it takes for the plugin to upload varies depending on your internet connection and internet speed. This should not take much time, as most plugins are small in size, not exceeding a few MBs.
5. Restart your server!
6. When you restart the server, the plugin will load, and you can start using it.

:::tip My Advice

Use the command `/plugins` in the game or in the console without `/` to see if the plugin has been loaded successfully. If it's shown in green, congratulations, the plugin you installed has been successfully loaded!

:::

:::note Note

If the plugin appears in red when using the `/plugins` command, it means it hasn't been loaded. This is likely caused by one or several of the following:
**a)** The plugin is incompatible with the game version.
**b)** The plugin requires another additional plugin to function correctly.
**c)** The plugin is broken and needs fixing by its developer.
